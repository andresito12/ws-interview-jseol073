# FIZ BUZZ

The goal of this problem is to write a function which iterates from numbers 1 to 100.  
If the number is divisible by 3, print FIZZ.  
If the number is divisible by 5, print BUZZ.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print FIZZBUZZ.  
Otherwise, print the number.

An example from 1 to 15:  
1  
2

def iterateNumList(list):  
  for i in list:  
    if i mod 3:  
      if i mod 5:  
        print("FIZZBUZZ")  
      else  
        print("FIZZ")  
    elif i mod 5:  
      print("BUZZ")
    else:  
      print(list[i])
